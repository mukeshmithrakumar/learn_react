# Become a Professional React Developer Specialization

[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/react)

**Course List**
- Learn React - 15 hours
- Learn Advanced React - 13 hours
- React JS Challenges - 9 hours

Note that Learn React course is also available for free in the scrimba site [here](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e). But the other two are paid so you can either get the Coursera one or the course directly from scrimba.

The pre-requisites for the course are
- [Learn JavaScript](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v)
- [Introduction to ES6+](https://v2.scrimba.com/introduction-to-es6-c0t)

and some HTML & CSS stuff but I am not going to go through HTML & CSS, just the above two. Since its project based, should be interesting.
